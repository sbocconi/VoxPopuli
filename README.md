# VoxPopuli
VOX POPULI is a system for automatic generation of Biased Video Sequences. In few words, VOX POPULI uses rhetorical annotations to generate video sequences. Our annotation schema encodes the verbal information contained in the audio channel, identifying the claims the interviewees make and the argumentation structures they use to make those claims. Based on this schema, we construct a semantic graph which is traversed by rhetoric-based strategies selecting video segments.
